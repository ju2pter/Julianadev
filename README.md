# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find a collection of my projects, focusing on **Cybersecurity** and **Backend Development** with **Python** and **Django**. I am passionate about these fields, and I continuously strive to develop practical solutions to real-world problems.

## Cybersecurity Projects

In this section, you will find projects focused on **network security**, **penetration testing**, and other areas of cybersecurity. I have hands-on experience with tools like **Nmap**, **Metasploit**, and **Wireshark**, among others. Here are some of my notable cybersecurity projects:

### 1. **Network Penetration Testing Toolkit**
   - A set of tools and scripts aimed at conducting penetration testing on networks. The toolkit includes various scanning and exploitation techniques used in red team exercises.
   - Technologies used: **Python**, **Nmap**, **Metasploit**, **Wireshark**

### 2. **Firewall Simulation and Vulnerability Scanning**
   - A simulated environment where I created a virtual firewall and tested various attack vectors to identify potential vulnerabilities. This project includes hands-on work with network traffic and firewall rules.
   - Technologies used: **Cisco Packet Tracer**, **Python**, **Scapy**

### 3. **VPN Security and Anonymity Project**
   - A project where I developed a **VPN** system using **Python** and **C**, with features like **IP masking** and **encrypted messaging** to ensure privacy and security for remote users.
   - Technologies used: **Python**, **OpenSSL**, **C**, **Networking**

## Backend Development with Python & Django

In this section, I showcase my backend development skills, particularly focusing on **Python** and **Django**. These projects demonstrate my ability to build secure, scalable, and efficient web applications. Below are a few examples:

### 1. **E-commerce Web Application**
   - A full-fledged e-commerce platform built with **Django**. The project involves user authentication, product management, shopping carts, and order processing.
   - Technologies used: **Django**, **Python**, **SQLite**, **HTML**, **CSS**

### 2. **Blogging Platform**
   - A platform for writing and sharing blogs with user authentication, commenting, and media upload features.
   - Technologies used: **Django**, **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, **Bootstrap**

### 3. **API Development with Django Rest Framework**
   - A RESTful API built using **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**. This API serves as a backend for managing user data, handling authentication, and enabling CRUD operations for various resources.
   - Technologies used: **Django Rest Framework**, **Python**, **JWT Authentication**, **PostgreSQL**

All of the backend projects are designed with security and performance in mind, utilizing best practices for both the development and deployment stages.
